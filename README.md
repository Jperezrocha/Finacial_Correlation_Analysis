For our project, we're looking at how different investments, like stocks and cryptocurrencies, move together or apart in the market. We want to see if there's a pattern in how they change together, and if news and people's opinions can tell us something about these patterns. Weâ€™re using financial data from Yahoo Finance to understand these connections and checking news from Kaggle to see if what people think and say affects these patterns. Our main goal is to create a simple trading strategy based on these connections, helping investors make smarter decisions
